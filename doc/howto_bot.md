# Taris Bot — User Guide

**@smartpico_bot** is a Telegram bot running on Raspberry Pi that provides AI chat, mail digest, system management, and voice interaction.

> **New users:** When you first send `/start`, your request is queued for admin approval. You will be notified once approved.

## Variants

Taris runs in two flavours depending on the hardware:

| Variant | Hardware | Web UI | STT |
|---|---|---|---|
| **taris / PicoClaw** | Raspberry Pi (OpenClawPI / OpenClawPI2) | `https://agents.sintaris.net/picoassist/` | Vosk (offline) |
| **OpenClaw** | Linux workstation (TariStation2 / TariStation1) | `http://localhost:8080/` (TariStation2) · `http://SintAItion:8080/` (TariStation1) | faster-whisper |

- **PicoClaw** is the default variant. All Pi-specific instructions in this guide apply to PicoClaw.
- **OpenClaw** runs on a local Linux workstation, uses **faster-whisper** for STT instead of Vosk, and supports remote **Ollama** LLM inference in addition to cloud providers.

---

## Getting Started

1. Open the bot in Telegram and send `/start`.
2. The bot shows a welcome message and the main menu.
3. Tap a menu button to enter a mode. Press **🔙 Menu** at any time to go back.

---

## Menu Modes

### 📧 Mail Digest
Fetches and summarises your Gmail inbox for the **last 24 hours** using an AI model.

- Tap **📧 Почта / Mail Digest** from the main menu.
- The last generated digest is shown immediately.
- Tap **🔄 Refresh** to fetch a fresh digest right now.
- The daily digest also runs automatically at **19:00** every day.

---

### 💬 Chat (Free Chat)
Open-ended conversation with the AI. Ask anything — questions, explanations, translations, creative tasks.

- Type your message and send it.
- The AI replies in the same language you write in.
- Press `/menu` or tap **🔙 Menu** to exit.

---

### 🖥️ System Chat

> ⚠️ **System Chat has moved to the Admin Panel.** It is no longer in the main menu and is accessible only to **Admin** and **Developer** users.

Ask about the state of the system in plain language. The bot translates your request into a shell command, shows it for confirmation, then executes it.

**Example requests:**
- `show disk usage`
- `list running services`
- `CPU temperature`
- `last 20 lines of voice.log`
- `memory usage`
- `uptime`

See **Admin Panel → System → 🖥️ System Chat** below.

---

### 🎤 Voice
Voice messages work in **all bot modes** — no separate Voice Session button is needed.

**How to send a voice message:**
1. Open the bot in any mode (💬 **Chat**, 📝 **Notes**, 🗓 **Calendar**, etc.)
2. In the Telegram input bar, hold the **🎤 microphone** button to record.
3. Release to send the voice message.
4. The bot transcribes your speech offline, sends the text to the AI, and replies with both text and a Piper TTS voice note.

> 🗣️ **PicoClaw (Pi):** STT model selected by Telegram language — Russian (`vosk-model-small-ru`) or German (`vosk-model-small-de`).  
> 🗣️ **OpenClaw (TariStation2 / SintAItion):** Uses **faster-whisper** (`small` model, int8) — more accurate than Vosk, all languages supported.  
> ⏱️ On TariStation2, the first voice message after a bot restart may take **3–5 seconds longer** while the STT model loads. All subsequent messages are fast.

| Toggle | Effect | Time saving |
|--------|--------|-------------|

## 🔍 Knowledge Base (RAG)

> 🧪 **BETA** — Available on both PicoClaw and OpenClaw variants.

Admins can upload documents to the bot's knowledge base. During chat, the most relevant text chunks are automatically prepended to the LLM prompt, grounding answers in your documents.

### Uploading Documents
- Open the Web UI and navigate to the **Admin** panel.
- Use the **Upload Document** form or send a `POST` request to `/admin/rag/upload`.
- Supported formats: plain text, Markdown, PDF (PyMuPDF + pdfminer fallback), DOCX.
- Documents are split into chunks (~512 characters) and indexed in **SQLite FTS5** full-text search.
- Duplicate documents (same SHA256 hash) are detected — you can replace or keep both.

### How RAG Works
1. User sends a message in 💬 Chat.
2. `bot_rag.classify_query()` routes the query: **simple** (skip RAG), **factual** (use RAG), **contextual** (RAG if docs available).
3. `bot_rag.retrieve_context()` selects search strategy based on hardware tier:
   - **FTS5_ONLY** — BM25 full-text search (low RAM)
   - **HYBRID** — BM25 + vector similarity + Reciprocal Rank Fusion (4–8 GB RAM)
   - **FULL** — hybrid + reranking (≥ 8 GB RAM)
4. Top-K chunks are prepended to the LLM prompt as `[KNOWLEDGE FROM USER DOCUMENTS]`.
5. LLM produces a grounded answer. Retrieval metrics logged to `rag_log`.

### Admin Controls (Telegram)
- Admin panel → **System** → **🔍 RAG / Knowledge Base** — toggle RAG on/off at runtime.
- Admin panel → **🔍 RAG** → **📊 Stats** — view retrieval latency, query type breakdown, top queries.
- The toggle writes/removes `~/.taris/rag_disabled` (flag file; presence = RAG off).

### Per-User RAG Settings
Each user can override the system defaults in **Profile → ⚙️ RAG Settings**:
- **Top-K** — number of chunks to inject (1–20, ± 1)
- **Chunk size** — maximum characters per chunk (200–4000, ± 200)
- Press **↩️ Reset** to restore system defaults.

### Configuration
| Constant | Default | Env var | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RAG_ENABLED` | `true` | `RAG_ENABLED` | Master on/off switch |
| `RAG_TOP_K` | `3` | `RAG_TOP_K` | Max chunks injected per request (overridable per-user) |
| `RAG_CHUNK_SIZE` | `512` | `RAG_CHUNK_SIZE` | Characters per chunk when indexing |
| `RAG_FLAG_FILE` | `~/.taris/rag_disabled` | — | Flag file (presence = RAG off) |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Bot doesn't respond | Service stopped | Admin: `sudo systemctl restart taris-telegram` |
| First voice message very slow (+3–5 s) | STT model lazy-loading (TariStation2 only) | Normal on first message after restart; all subsequent messages are fast |
| Menu buttons freeze / "query is too old" | Memory pressure (check swap with `free -m`) | Admin: verify `FASTER_WHISPER_PRELOAD=0` in bot.env; see admin guide |
| Voice reply missing audio | Piper not installed | Run `setup_voice.sh` |
| Mail digest fails | Gmail credentials expired | Check IMAP App Password in `bot.env` |
| "Admins only" on System Chat | You are a guest user | Ask admin to upgrade your access |
| Voice not recognised | Spoke non-Russian | Use Russian (default STT model is Russian) |
| Button press does nothing | Markdown parse error | Update bot to latest version |
| Registration pending forever | Admin hasn't approved | Ask admin to check Pending Requests in admin panel |
| `/start` shows wrong menu | Role mismatch in `bot.env` | Check `ALLOWED_USERS` / `ADMIN_USERS` in `bot.env` |
| Web UI shows `502 Bad Gateway` | Pi tunnel disconnected | Check `systemctl status taris-tunnel` on the Pi |
| Web login fails (wrong password) | Wrong web credentials | Use Telegram linking to re-register with correct creds |
| Browser shows SSL certificate warning | Self-signed cert on local access | Accept / add exception; public URL has a valid cert |
| Link code expired | Codes are valid 15 minutes | Tap 🔗 Link to Web again to get a fresh code |
| Web registered but can't log in | Account pending approval | Ask admin to approve, or use a Telegram link code |
